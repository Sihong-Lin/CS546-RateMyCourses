                'Personal computing is now mobile and cloud-based. Disconnected mobile computing challenges many of the assumptions underlying much of todays distributed systems.  Cloud computing provides a powerful background computing facility for mobile devices, but also raises important issues of trust and privacy.  Many of these issues arise in critical yet sensitive domains such as electronic healthcare delivery.  Mobile computing applications are location-aware or context-aware; the privacy implications of these applications are profound.  Mobile, and increasingly location aware, gaming systems are now one of the largest sectors of the world entertainment industry. The purpose of this course is to review the fundamentals of mobile systems and applications, and how they relate to services in the cloud.  The course will review material from wireless communication, distributed systems, and security and privacy, as they pertain to the systems being studied.  The course will involve programming mobile apps using a popular mobile computing platform, such as Android or iPhone, to get hands-on experience with the concepts being discussed in the class.  Programming experience with Java or C# is required Pre-requisite: Graduate Students -  Undergraduate data structures and algorithms and experience in Java or C# OR CS 590.

Compared with traditional benchtop operations, LOC-based assays offer a broader range of unique advantages. In particular, compact LOC devices can carry out cost-effective, rapid, and portable biochemical analyses with considerably high resolution and sensitivity through the use of small amounts of reagents and samples (typically, several micro-liters) in a tightly controlled user-defined environment. The overall goal of this course is to help students gain comprehensive understanding of the field of LOC, including device fabrication methods, recent technologic progress, current challenges and limitations to overcome, and future perspectives, with special focus on biomedical applications of different LOC devices. Notably, this course will highlight cutting-edge LOC technologies that enabled creation of devices for low-cost gene extraction and sequencing, accurate single-cell analysis, and high-throughput drug screening. Further, students will learn innovative LOC devices that are being used for high-fidelity in vitro disease modeling and therapeutic development.

In the beginning, the course covers computational goals to including statistics, smoothing data, numerical integration and calculation of volumes to teach/review basic programming logic, loops and function calls. Then we focus on more complex tasks such as simulation, localization and path planning for robotics, and teach object-oriented programming as part of an efficient solution to these engineering problems. By the end of the course, students will have a thorough knowledge of C++.', // description
